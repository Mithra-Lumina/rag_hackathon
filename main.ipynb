      "## Education or knowledge is only one aspect of motivating behaviour change\n",
      "In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change concluded that behavioural interventions could increase the efficacy of subsidies and taxes. In their recommendations on decarbonization, the Science Academies of G7 countries urged governments to strengthen climate literacy and citizen involvement and to promote behaviour-oriented science to support transformative social innovations and increase support for technologies, policies and routines for carbon-neutral lifestyles (Jenny and Betsch, 2022).\n",
      "A review of 10 meta-analyses on climate change mitigation field-based interventions found that the 6 intervention categories (education, feedback, commitment, appeals, financial incentives and social comparison) were generally effective in motivating climate action.

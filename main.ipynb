      "## Education or knowledge is only one aspect of motivating behaviour change\n",
      "In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change concluded that behavioural interventions could increase the efficacy of subsidies and taxes. In their recommendations on decarbonization, the Science Academies of G7 countries urged governments to strengthen climate literacy and citizen involvement and to promote behaviour-oriented science to support transformative social innovations and increase support for technologies, policies and routines for carbon-neutral lifestyles (Jenny and Betsch, 2022).\n",
      "A review of 10 meta-analyses on climate change mitigation field-based interventions found that the 6 intervention categories (education, feedback, commitment, appeals, financial incentives and social comparison) were generally effective in motivating climate action. Interventions based on social comparisons and financial incentives were the most effective, while those based on education and feedback were the least effective (Bergquist et al., 2023). While education is needed to make the public aware of a problem, it may not be effective at changing behaviours without additional interventions that include social-emotional and action components.\n",
      "Climate change communication and education is most effective in motivating action when framed in the language, values and priorities of communities (Callison, 2020). Message framing strategies are needed to prompt action among those who believe in climate change and those who do not, especially if they are strongly swayed by political ideology (Badullovich et al., 2020). Climate messages that appeal to free market beliefs, security or patriotism; emphasize the near universalization of the climate scientist consensus; and use tools to enable adults to tackle misinformation are better suited to win over those resistant to action. Messaging based on hope to maintain urgency and emphasizing social norms of environment-protecting behaviour are strategies that can motivate action among climate change believers (Hornsey and Fielding, 2020).\n",

Although natural events such as volcanic eruptions or variations in the Sun's energy output can cause some incremental changes in the climate, the scientific evidence is clear that human activity is the principal cause of the rapid climate change we are experiencing.\\nOur consumption of fossil fuels is the largest contributor to global climate change .3 We burn fossil fuels for energy to power our homes, cars, planes, tractors, and industries. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO ) and 2 other gases (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide) that accumulate in the atmosphere. Although these gases occur naturally in small quantities, increasing their levels in the atmosphere acts like a heat-trapping blanket around the Earth.\\nFossil fuels-coal, oil, and gas-are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.\\nAs greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat. This leads to global warming and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth. 4\\nThe global disruption caused by climate change is occurring at an unprecedented rate. Climate change can result in fundamental transformations of ecosystems and the displacement or loss of plants, animals, and other species. Longer, more intense droughts threaten wildlife and freshwater supplies and feed more intense wildfires. Temperature-sensitive fish and other marine life are changing migration patterns toward cooler and deeper waters to survive.\"),\n",

And, although climate change may appear to have some potential benefits in some areas (e.g., longer growing seasons, changing ranges of some plants), the predominant impacts are negative: water- and food-related illnesses, forced displacement, workforce changes, increased hunger, poorer nutrition, worsening air quality, spread of infectious diseases, respiratory and heart diseases, extreme heat, and threats to water quality and quantity.\\nIn the end, 'future climate change impacts depend on choices made today.' 6 Climate education can help people understand climate systems and build the skills and the collective will necessary to make the choices needed for change.\\n- 3 United Nations.

Although natural events such as volcanic eruptions or variations in the Sun's energy output can cause some incremental changes in the climate, the scientific evidence is clear that human activity is the principal cause of the rapid climate change we are experiencing.\\nOur consumption of fossil fuels is the largest contributor to global climate change .3 We burn fossil fuels for energy to power our homes, cars, planes, tractors, and industries. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO ) and 2 other gases (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide) that accumulate in the atmosphere. Although these gases occur naturally in small quantities, increasing their levels in the atmosphere acts like a heat-trapping blanket around the Earth.\\nFossil fuels-coal, oil, and gas-are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.\\nAs greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat. This leads to global warming and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth. 4\\nThe global disruption caused by climate change is occurring at an unprecedented rate. Climate change can result in fundamental transformations of ecosystems and the displacement or loss of plants, animals, and other species. Longer, more intense droughts threaten wildlife and freshwater supplies and feed more intense wildfires. Temperature-sensitive fish and other marine life are changing migration patterns toward cooler and deeper waters to survive.\"),\n",

The ten hottest years on record have occurred since 1998. Sea levels are rising; ever more frequent natural disasters, such as cyclones and tropical storms, are threatening people's homes and live lihoods. In its latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stressed that 'a changing climate creates pervasive risks, but opportunities exist for effective responses' .\\nClimate Change Education is a powerful tool for developing such responses and helping people address climate change. It helps learners understand the causes and consequences of climate change. It prepares them to live with the impacts of climate change and empowers learners to take appropriate actions to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. Communities can learn about how climate change will affect them, what they can do to protect themselves from negative consequences, and how they can reduce their own climate footprint. In particular, education can help increase the resilience of already vulnerable communities who are the most likely to be adversely affected by climate change.\\nThis publication presents UNESCO's work on Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development in 2012/2013.\\nUnited Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization\\nJapan Funds-in-Trust\"),\n",
